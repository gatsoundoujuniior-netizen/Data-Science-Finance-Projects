"As part of my Data Extraction and Processing (DP) project, I developed a script for an international firm to extract and process the list of the top 10 largest economies in the world, ranked by GDP in billion USD (rounded to 2 decimal places), based on data published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This project demonstrates my ability to automate data retrieval and transform raw information into a structured format suitable for analysis."
